	-The time of the high and low temperature for a given date
	-Background color to indicate the general temperature of the day
	-Small icons to indicate whether there is precipitation
	-Horizontally Oriented information containers for each day of the week
	-A trend graph + relevant statistics for the week at the top of each page (before the individual cards)
	-A navigation bar for each location that the user wants to view information for
	-Blurbs for concerning information occuring on a given day (if the air quality is bad, etc)
	-CoolWeather's logo, for a change of design among the weather-related information
	-The option to display information on external topics, such as pollen, sunrise + sunset, and UV index

I will not be including the following:
	-Daily/weekly Information about the air pressure
	-Daily/weekly Information on the lunar cycle
